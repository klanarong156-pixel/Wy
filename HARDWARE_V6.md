## Operating notes

All relays are set to OFF at boot. The pump follows the schedule or explicit relay/timer command selected by the operator; there is no forced 30-minute runtime cutoff and no automatic MQTT-loss cutoff. Schedules stored in LittleFS remain active even if MQTT is unavailable. A finite timer turns a relay OFF only when that explicitly requested countdown expires; `UNLIMITED` intentionally has no timer expiry. HTTP/ArduinoOTA forces relays OFF only during firmware update. A dashboard Emergency Stop latch is separate from a physical E-stop/contactor and must not be the only safety layer for a real pump.

> D3/GPIO0, D4/GPIO2 and D8/GPIO15 are ESP8266 boot-strap pins. The connected RTC and relay circuits must not force an invalid boot level while the board starts.
